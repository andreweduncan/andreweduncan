- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andreweduncan </br>
Currently, I am a **Data Engineer** at Candlescience working with **SQL** and **Python**

Feel free to drop me a line with any questions about my work in </br>
**Looker**, **Hex**, **DBT**, **Google Bigquery**, </br>
or anything else that strikes your interest. </br>

In the future, I hope to update a fun project I did creating a data pipeline from 
the World of Warcraft auction house using **python-based API calls** into a **local Postgres SQL instance**.

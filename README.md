- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @andreweduncan
Currently, I am a Data Engineer at Candlescience working with SQL and Python

Feel free to drop me a line with any questions about my work in Looker, Hex, DBT, 
Google Bigquery, or anything else that strikes your interest.

In the future, I hope to update a fun project I did creating a data pipeline from 
the World of Warcraft auction house using python-based API calls into a local PSQL instance.

Nerd.
Husband.
Former Army Infantry Squad Leader.
UNC Alum.
Get at me.
